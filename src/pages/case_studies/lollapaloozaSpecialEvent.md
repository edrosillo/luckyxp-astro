Forum 55 stands on the concourse level of the 50-story Mid-Continental Plaza at 55 E. Monroe Street. The market place features 10 different vendors and includes a grab and go eatery for a quick bite right in the center of the loop in Chicago. We stepped in and managed an event for Forum 55 when it mattered most and got a team in within hours of the initial set up call and interview. Because Chicago is one of our major hubs we are able to create teams quickly in this market.
Our team promoted Forum 55 within close walking distance of Lollapalooza. They made sure that everyone attending knew that Forum 55 was close by and this was THE SPOT for your morning, lunch, and dinner needs close to Millennium Park. Our team worked the morning shift, arrived early, stayed late, and ensured the clients needs were met. They needed to have a great shift especially after having a hard time with a previous agency. We made it happen in a pinch and they had a successful event.
