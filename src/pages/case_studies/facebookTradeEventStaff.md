Facebook business gives businesses the latest tools and insights for succeeding on #Facebook and #Instagram. Small businesses learn from experts, local organizations, and other businesses in the area. Attendees walk away with the resources they need to grow their business through #boostyourbusiness.
Our team works these events all over the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico. We have been the Facebook team since Feb. 2017. Our team works the Registration desk, photo team leads, wayfinders, and more. Each event could need something different based on the number of attendees at the event. These teams are tons of fun for our teams!
