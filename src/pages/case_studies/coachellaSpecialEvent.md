Lucky Marketing was contracted to help reach 50k Coachella fans with beauty product samples! Our teams had a blast at Coachella, making some awesome connections for our clients!

Music Festivals are some of our favorite events to work with for many reasons. We have clients that request specific events for many reasons at festivals. Shea Moisture and Nubian Heritage realize that a large demographic from their target audience is in the crowd at many of the festivals/special events! Many of the attendees are already familiar with the brands and they LOVE the samples that come to them. Many are unaware of all the locations you can purchase or have common questions about the product(s). Our staff helps close the gap and convert ‘would-be’ customers to ‘long-term’ customers! All done while waiting in line to get into their show or walking around the festival grounds! How’s that for #GuerrillaMarketing?!
